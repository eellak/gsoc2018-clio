# Clio

Clio is a web based system for maintaining (meta-)information on software components.

## Repository Structure

Top-level directory `doc - [https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-clio/blob/master/doc/report.md]` is where the notes, progress reports, etc are maintained.

## Collaborating

For real time collaboration, we use a dedicated zulip at [http://clio.zulipchat.com](http://clio.zulipchat.com)
